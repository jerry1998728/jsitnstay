- Truly personalized, reliable care
- Socialization opportunities with proper interaction monitoring
- Conflict management and separation strategy to protect everyone

Q: How do you handle conflicts and fights?
A: As Jerry is home pretty much all the time, he listens and monitors any interactions between pets and steps in with authority to make sure conflicts are ceased. Even when he is out for a grocery run, he would separate pets with potential conflicts away from each other to make sure a 200% peace environment.

Q: My cat(s) is super afraid of new environment, how would you take care of my cat?
A: In Jerry's opinion, cats are quite territorial so he would give as much as space to allow them to settle in, get comfortable, feel safe in the new environment. He would be trespassing cats territory if he tries to pet or feed them while they are still being protective. To be specific, Jerry goes with the flow for cats to help them adapt better.

Q: How would you handle interactions or conflicts between cats and dogs?
A: Jerry, as an experienced pet sitter who prioritizes pets before anything else, he takes notes and keeps in mind the pets' friendliness and background! For example, he uses a friendliness score on a scale of 0-1 and asks about a pet's growing background to get a decent understanding of their fundamental behaviors.
